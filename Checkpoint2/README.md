### Part B

<p>These two commands differ in function. "Git Status" tells us if the branch is up to date, of files that are untracked, staged, or unstaged, files that are modified, created or deleted, and whether if there's anything to commit. For an example if you created a file, the file will be mentioned in the output of Git Status as an untracked file and that it can be added(staged).

"Git Log" on the other hand gives you an output of what commits has been done on the repository. For example where you are dealing with a project, you can use the "Git Log" command to check the commit history of that project. This allows you to see the changes and when it was made which you or the collaborator(s) have made on the project. </p>
